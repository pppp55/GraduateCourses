Based on the given train-test split data, (X_train, y_train) & (X_test, y_test), 
evaluate and compare the best out-sample performance(accuracy) of 4 types of models
with settings specified as below:
    1. DecisionTreeClassifier with 
        the best `max_depth` from cadidates provided in `max_depth_candidates`
    2. LogisticRegression with 
        `max_iter`=100000, 
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`
    3. LinearSVC with 
        'max_iter`=100000, 
        `dual`='auto',
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`
    4. SVC with 
        `max_iter`=100000, 
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`

Noteï¼š
    1. Always set random_state = 0 for all the models
    2. Record the performance of each parameter for each type of model and then
        sort to get the best model parameter(s) and corresponding performance for each model
    3. Compare the performance of 4 types of models
