Based on the given training data (X, y_true), use the defined `skf` to 
perform a 5-fold corss-validation to evaluate and compare the best out-sample 
performance(accuracy) of 4 types of models with settings specified as below:
    1. DecisionTreeClassifier with 
        the best `max_depth` from cadidates provided in `max_depth_candidates`
    2. LogisticRegression with 
        `max_iter`=100000, 
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`
    3. LinearSVC with 
        'max_iter`=100000, 
        `dual`='auto',
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`
    4. SVC with 
        `max_iter`=100000, 
        and the best `C` from cadidates provided in `C_candidates`

Noteï¼š
    1. Always set random_state = 0 for all the models
    2. Record the performance of each parameter for each type of model and then
        sort to get the best model parameter(s) and corresponding performance for each model
    3. Compare the performance of 4 types of models
    4. Consider using cross_val_score to perform corss-validation with 
        the defined `skf`
